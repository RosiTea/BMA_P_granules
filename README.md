# BMA_P_granules
Major executable model I worked on for my Part III Systems Biology Mini Project on modelling P granule polarisation in C. elegans embryo 

## Notes on ml_train_data
This folder contains the Machine Learning training data generated over 1200 Smoldyn simulations. This is one of the other parts of our project. The code will generate 1200 CSV files if completed, so for simplicity only the final CSV file is kept here. For more about Smoldyn and ML, see https://github.com/toby-clark4/Mini-Project.
